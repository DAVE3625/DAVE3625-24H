# Mandatory Assignment 2: Machine Learning

#### **You <u>must</u> work in groups of 2-4.**
You have 10 days to work on a machine-learning algorithm.
Pick one of the following use cases and make a prediction algorithm using either regression or classification algorithms.

Do the following:
1. Pick one use case (defined below).
2. Explore and research which algorithm would work best for this use case (regression or classification)
3. Document your findings in a markdown cell (3-5 lines) on why you chose this algorithm.
4. Train the algorithm using Python
5. Keep the solution as simple as possible. We are not looking for the best machine-learning algorithm. We are interested in seeing that you know how to work with machine learning.
6. Turn in a **JUPYTER NOTEBOOK** on canvas.


You can pick one of the following use cases:

1. Predict stock market price for TESLA.
Make a prediction algorithm which predicts the price of this stock on a specific date. Input will be date and output should be price of that stock (close value in the data file).
You should also show the prediction percentage score.
Data file: TESLA.csv

2. Predict passenger data for Ruter.
Use Ruter-data.csv dataset (in data folder). I want you to make a prediction algorithm which predicts the number of passengers on a specific date for a specific bus (pick any one). Input should be date and output will be number of passengers
You should also show the prediction percentage score. 
Data file: Ruter_data.csv

3. Find your own dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets and make a prediction algorithm using regression or classification. You should also show the  prediction percentage score.
**IMPORTANT, you must  upload the dataset in your submission if you choose to pick your own dataset and prediction.**

Remember, we are **not** looking for a 30-page submission. Do not make it too complicated. 
<u>Keep it simple and to the point.</u>

Feel free to ask us for help in the labs if you are stuck or need help.
